# Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing datasets to understand the footprint of processed food in the United States. Our team consists of:

- Choi Yat Long (National University of Singapore)
- Lihua Guo (Tsinghua University)
- Mulan Qin (National University of Singapore)
- Ruichen Li (University of Sydney)

Shortlisted in the Top 30 teams for the APAC Citadel Datathon 2024, we tackled two key questions: the relationship between meat production and the financial market, and the uniformity of its impact on various stakeholders. We developed a Poultry Production Index (PPI) and evaluated its ability to predict annual stock returns in the processed food sector using the Granger Causality Test. We also examined the link between meat production, obesity trends, and socio-economic indicators, finding that while meat production positively correlates with employment rates, it significantly contributes to rising obesity rates, especially in middle-aged populations.

## Abstract
In recent years, the U.S. economy has experienced growth alongside an increase in obesity, a disease of affluence. A key contributor to these trends is the processed meat industry, which plays a vital role in the economy and American fast-food culture. However, the comprehensive impact of meat production on the financial market and society has been underexplored.

This report aims to clarify the relationship between meat production and its broader financial and societal effects. Our analysis revealed a negative correlation between meat production and stocks in the processed food sector. Socially, meat production promotes unhealthy eating habits and drives obesity rates higher, while also contributing to lower unemployment by creating job opportunities.

In summary, while meat production supports the macroeconomy, it requires government intervention to address the associated public health challenges.











The abstract is In recent years, the U.S. economy has experienced
growth, paralleled by an increase in a disease of affluence,
obesity. A significant contributor behind these trends may
be the processed meat industry, a cornerstone of the economy
and a staple in the American fast-food culture. Until
now, the comprehensive impact of meat production on the financial
market and the society has remained underexplored.
This report aims to elucidate the relationship between meat
production and its broader financial and societal effects.
Our study begins with an analysis of the correlation between
meat production and financial markets, revealing a
negative correlation with stocks in sectors related to processed
food. We further examined the social ramifications
of meat production, highlighting its role in promoting unhealthy
eating habits and increasing obesity rates, while also
contributing to a lower unemployment rate by providing employment
opportunities.
In summary, although meat production bolsters the
macroeconomy, it necessitates governmental intervention to
address the accompanying health challenges.
