# Understanding the Impact of Processed Food Production on the U.S. Economy and Society

This project focuses on analyzing datasets to understand the footprint of processed food in the United States. Our team consists of:

- **Choi Yat Long** (National University of Singapore)  
- **Lihua Guo** (Tsinghua University)  
- **Mulan Qin** (National University of Singapore)  
- **Ruichen Li** (University of Sydney)

Shortlisted in the Top 30 teams for the APAC Citadel Datathon 2024, we addressed two key questions: the relationship between meat production and the financial market, and the equity and uniformity of its impact on various stakeholders. We developed a Poultry Production Index (PPI) and evaluated its predictive power on annual stock returns in the processed food sector using the Granger Causality Test. Additionally, we explored the connection between meat production, obesity trends, and socio-economic indicators, discovering that while meat production positively correlates with employment rates, it significantly contributes to rising obesity rates, particularly in middle-aged populations.

## Executive Summary

### 1.1 Background
The US economy has been flourishing since the 2008 financial crisis. Without a shadow of a doubt, prosperity is always one of the goals that every government fights for. Nevertheless, some may have noticed affluence is also associated with some illnesses, known as diseases of affluence. Office workers may order fast food to save time for work, while others may simply prefer a more convenient lifestyle.

Originating in the US, fast food has become a popular choice for many citizens. A quick visit to a nearby fast food restaurant offers customers delicious burgers, French fries, and Coke. However, when health issues are overlooked, processed meat becomes very tempting. As a result, fast food chains and processed meat companies are enjoying strong financial health.

Unfortunately, by neglecting proper dietary habits and healthy lifestyles, obesity has surged to 33% in recent years. A diet with excessive meat and fewer vegetables can lead to obesity, which is associated with numerous illnesses, including diabetes. Therefore, addressing obesity is of utmost importance, as its impact on the healthcare system and society could be overwhelming.

To further investigate the relationship between increasing processed meat production and its effects on society, this report conducts research to uncover how these trends impact us.

### 1.2 Main Questions
In this study, we address two central questions:
1. Could meat production be an indicator for the financial health, as reflected by stock market performance?
2. What is the social impact of meat production on different stakeholders?

### 1.3 Key Findings
1. To explore the relationship between meat production and the stock market, we introduced the Poultry Production Index (PPI) as an innovative metric reflecting meat production levels and its correlation with obesity rates. Our investigation reveals significant negative correlations between PPI and the annual stock returns of companies in the processed food sector. Companies such as Starbucks, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, and Conagra Brands serve as notable examples of this trend. Moreover, our Granger causality analysis substantiates the predictive power of PPI values on stock returns, particularly within the manufacturing sector. This suggests that increases in meat production, as indicated by rising PPI values, may paradoxically have a negative impact on the financial performance of the processed food industry.
   
2. Meat production has a positive effect on employment, likely due to the increased job opportunities it provides. However, it also contributes to higher obesity rates, likely by changing people’s eating habits. As meat production rises, fewer people are consuming an adequate amount of vegetables, leading to health concerns.
