# Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing datasets to understand the footprint of processed food in the United States. Shortlisted in the Top 30 teams for the APAC Citadel Datathon 2024, our team addressed two main questions: the relationship between meat production and the financial market, and the uniformity of its impact on various stakeholders. We developed a Poultry Production Index (PPI) and assessed its predictive power on annual stock returns in the processed food sector using the Granger Causality Test. Additionally, we explored the connection between meat production, obesity trends, and socio-economic indicators, finding that meat production positively correlates with employment rates but contributes significantly to rising obesity rates, particularly in middle-aged populations.
